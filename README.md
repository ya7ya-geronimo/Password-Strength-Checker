# Password-Strength-Checker
🔐 Password Strength Checker

A Password Strength Checker project implemented in Python (with a GUI) and C++ (console-based) that helps users create secure passwords. The program evaluates passwords based on security rules, calculates a score (0–100), and provides feedback to improve password strength.

📝 Description

This project aims to promote good password practices by helping users understand how strong their passwords are. It checks for:

Minimum length (8 characters)

At least 1 uppercase letter

At least 1 lowercase letter

At least 1 number

At least 1 special character

The Python version uses a GUI with Tkinter, making it user-friendly, while the C++ version runs in the console. Both versions give detailed feedback and classify password strength as Weak, Medium, or Strong.





🚀 Features

✅ Password strength evaluation

✅ Score calculation from 0 to 100

✅ Clear feedback on missing requirements

✅ Classification: Weak / Medium / Strong

✅ Python GUI version (Tkinter)
